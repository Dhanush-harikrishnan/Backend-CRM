## 🧮 GST Calculation Logic

### Intra-State (Same State)
- CGST = 50% of total GST rate
- SGST = 50% of total GST rate
- IGST = 0

### Inter-State (Different States)
- CGST = 0
- SGST = 0
- IGST = Full GST rate

### Example: 18% GST on ₹10,000
**Intra-State:**
- Taxable: ₹10,000
- CGST (9%): ₹900
- SGST (9%): ₹900
- Total: ₹11,800

**Inter-State:**
- Taxable: ₹10,000
- IGST (18%): ₹1,800
- Total: ₹11,800
